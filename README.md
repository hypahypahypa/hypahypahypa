Hello. My name is George, I am a data analyst. I conduct a market and product analysis. I calculate metrics such as CPL, CR, ROI, I do a cohort analysis and prepare a data visualization.
Iâ€™m studying at an online-course as a data analyst. I also regularly read articles on the Internet, listen to lectures and master literature on the topic, because it is important for me to constantly develop and grow as a specialist.

I tried different specialties, but I feel best in IT, as my abilities of logical thinking, perseverance and search for original solutions are valued here.
Since I started doing this, I have met many people who share the same qualities, interests and goals that I do.
I have a good command of logic, which helps me in compiling SQL queries. I also have a good command of English, which helps me to master an infinite number of educational materials and communicate with specialists on international resources.

My hobby is cycling. I have been cycling regularly for three years now. I ride every day, constantly breaking my records and my dream is to participate in a mass bike ride.
